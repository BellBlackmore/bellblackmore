Hello This is my first offical post on this blog. I will be using this blog to update my progress on different projects. This is the first project as of running a blog. 
Other projects include working with docker, Linux, Applications and more. 

Update this current blog post will take a while to be worked on. I need to figure out how to get the post to generate through github.   

``` bash
WARN  Theme configurations failed one or more checks.
WARN  Icarus may still run, but you will encounter unexcepted results.
WARN  Here is some information for you to correct the configuration file.
WARN  [
  {
    instancePath: '/head/open_graph/twitter_id',
    schemaPath: '/misc/open_graph.json/properties/twitter_id/type',
    keyword: 'type',
    params: { type: 'string' },
    message: 'must be string'
  }
]
```
^ Above is the error I'm currently getting with my command line.
 I started this project 09/15/2022 at 5 AM. I worked on it all day and finally got it uploaded to github around 7 PM. I kept on working until 11:48 PM.
